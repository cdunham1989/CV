## Hobbies and Interests

I am an avid consumer of media, spending a lot of time reading literature, watching films and playing video games. I greatly enjoy traveling and experiencing different cultures and I have gained an advanced level qualification in SCUBA diving whilst doing this. In my spare time, I have begun to research the field of coding and programming due to an innate interest in this area.
