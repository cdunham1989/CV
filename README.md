## Hobbies and Interests

I am an avid consumer of media, spending a lot of time reading literature, going to the theatre, cinema and playing video games. I greatly enjoy traveling and experiencing different cultures, I have gained an advanced level qualification in SCUBA diving whilst doing this. I also enjoy learning things in my spare time, I am currently learning how to bake and find this helps me unwind after a long day at work.
