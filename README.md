I'm a self professed geek, full of little facts about how things work or why things happen. Since I was a child I've always enjoyed learning a wide range of things, challenging myself to develop in new and exciting ways. In my adult life so far this has taken me in a number of different directions. From secondary science teaching, to professional development of managers at a university in central London.

I've always been creatively minded and have had little opportunity to explore this side of myself in my career. I believe learning to code and becoming a software developer will give me this opportunity and that really excites me.

Let's get stuck in!

## Hobbies and Interests

I am an avid consumer of media, spending a lot of time reading literature, going to the theatre, cinema and playing video games. I greatly enjoy traveling and experiencing different cultures, I have gained an advanced level qualification in SCUBA diving whilst doing this. I also enjoy learning things in my spare time, I am currently learning how to bake and find this helps me unwind after a long day at work.
